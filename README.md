A individual project

Raspberry pi is a minicomputer, hence it has ports which need to be wiring of the project. Powering source comes from the PIR sensor, that is, only the sensor is powered, and it relays the power to the other devices in the connections like the raspberry module and buzzer. Starting from the PIR sensor, positive terminal is connected to pin 4 of raspberry pi, ground to pin 6, and the third terminal to pin 21,26 for the LED and buzzer output pin. 
The project responds positively when powered on. Several pins of the raspberry pi module make it possible to integrate several devices according to the objective. The following diagram has been used for illustration. The flow diagram shows how the PIR sensor behaves when there is an intruder and no intruder. It registers a 1 and 0 when there is an intruder and not respectively. The PIR sensor used is a wired sensor of 5V DC. Figure 1 below illustrates the system flow diagram.
